This is a work for Computer Graphics (Master Engineering Computer Science).
It's a mix of HTML, Javascript and Shading Language that allow to develop with 
WebGL libraries.

There are 2 variants of the same application, one with textures and another without them.

Greater emphasis is in Shading Language, where there is the management of the lights, which
include:
- Ambient  light
- Specular light
- Diffuse  light

PS: the browser requires the permissions to access to file (in this case required to access to textures),
    then in according to your preffered browser remember to give it permission, otherwise you will not see the textures.
    
    CHROME:  1. Add the path of Chrome.exe in PATH of SYSTEM ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
             2. Execute Command Prompt with Administrator Privileges
             3. launch "chrome.exe --allow-file-access-from-files"
             
    FIREFOX:  1. write in the URL bar "about:config"
              2. set the field "security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy = false"
